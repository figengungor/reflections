What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It adds .git file which keeps some metadata about my project. It basically starts version controlling. I need to do it to be able to commit my changes and keep the history and the other cool stuff that you're gonna teach me in later videos.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area contains the file(s) that I'm about to commit as a logical change into my repository. My untracked file(s) are in the working directory and I don't have to add all of my files at once as a commit to repository. I can group my files logically and add them to staging area and then commit them with a proper info message.
